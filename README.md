# Flappy Bird

### About the process coding this program
I have been learning Java in class, but never really programmed an actual fully functional program, so I wanted to somewhat create one. Since I have never used Java for an actual full program, I was still doubting how to implement some of the code that I learnt or maybe if there was other code or functions that I did not learn in order to program an actual program, so I decided to search for tutorials on some interesting projects in order to get used to the way to use the code, and found the tutorial on Flappy Bird, throughout the tutorial I was able to see how some codes and functions that I knew could be implemented in a functioning program and also learnt some new code or functions which I will be able to use it for future projects or in a job.

### Future plans for this project
The majority of this program was following a tutorial, so my plan is to add in some more features and changing couple of things, some extra features that was not explained in the tutorial has already been added, but my plan, since it is my first actual project using Java, is to keep adding and changing things, because it will really show that I understand each and every line of code that I have followed and can be effectively used on future projects.

### Some information about the game
The game is basically as the classic Flappy Bird, click or press down the space bar to jump or fly (not pressing and holding, actually click or press for every jump higher), when hit a tube or column the game will be over, your current score will show and also the highest score.
